# Converting-Words
A Java program which converts words systematicly. Basic encryption.

Program will run untill user enters exit. We are using do while for that. Here is the how algorith converts the word: It individually takes all of the characters from word and control them. If the character is not a letter it converts it to *, if the character is a letter and used only once in that word it converts it to '(' and if it is at least used twice then it converts to ')'. 

I would love to see your comments, suggestions and upgrades for this project! Hope you like it.
